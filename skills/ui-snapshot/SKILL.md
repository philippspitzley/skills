description: After building any UI component, extract the visual patterns that matter for consistency and save them to context/ui-registry.md. Use when a new UI component is built, when asked to capture component patterns, or when running an audit on existing UI.

# Imprint

Extracts visual patterns from UI components and saves them to `context/ui-registry.md` so every component built after this one matches what came before.

## How to Invoke

After building any UI component, run:

```
/ui-snapshot
```

To target a specific file:

```
/ui-snapshot [filepath]
```

To audit an existing codebase for inconsistencies:

```
/ui-snapshot audit
```

If no filepath is given, the skill identifies recently created or modified component files automatically and captures from those.

---

## Standard Mode — `/ui-snapshot`

### Step 1 — Find What Was Just Built

If a filepath was provided — read that file directly.

If no filepath was provided — identify which component files were most recently created or modified in this session. Look in the components directory and any other locations where UI files typically live. Read those files.

If it is unclear which files to capture from, ask the developer:

```
Which component should I capture patterns from?
```

### Step 2 — Read the Registry

Use your `read` tool to load `context/ui-registry.md`. If it does not exist, create it with a blank `## Entries` section.

Check if an entry for this component type already exists. If it does, you will update it rather than duplicating.

### Step 3 — Extract What Matters for Consistency

Read the component code. Extract only the classes and values that affect visual consistency across the interface. Not everything — only what makes components look like they belong together.

**Extract these:**

- Background — what bg- class is used for the container, cards, panels
- Border — border color, border width, border style
- Border radius — rounded- class used for this component type
- Text colors — primary text, secondary text, muted text classes
- Text sizes and weights — for headings, body, labels, captions
- Spacing — padding inside the component, gap between elements
- Interactive states — hover, focus, active classes
- Shadow — if used
- Any accent or brand color usage

**Do not extract these:**

- Width and height — too context-dependent to be a consistency rule
- Flex and grid layout — structural, not visual
- Positioning — absolute, relative, z-index — context-dependent
- Animation and transition timing — unless it is a pattern worth enforcing
- Responsive breakpoint variants — capture the base pattern only

**Also capture structure:**

- How the component is composed (wrapper elements, nesting)
- Title/body/layout pattern
- Icon placement relative to text
- Slot or children pattern

### Step 4 — Write to ui-registry.md

Open `context/ui-registry.md`. If it does not exist, create it.

Add a new entry for the component that was captured. Do not overwrite existing entries — append to the registry.

If an entry for this component type already exists — update it rather than duplicating.

### Entry format

```markdown
### [Component Name]

File: [filepath]
Last updated: [date]

**Structure:**
[How the component is composed — wrapper elements,
nesting, title/body/layout pattern]

| Property         | Class           |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| Background       | [class]         |
| Border           | [class]         |
| Border radius    | [class]         |
| Text — primary   | [class]         |
| Text — secondary | [class]         |
| Spacing          | [class]         |
| Hover state      | [class]         |
| Shadow           | [class or none] |
| Accent usage     | [class or none] |

**Pattern notes:**
[Any important pattern decisions worth noting —
why a specific class was chosen, what this component
should always match, what variations are allowed]
```

### Step 5 — Confirm What Was Captured

After writing to ui-registry.md, confirm to the developer:

```
Imprinted [Component Name] → ui-registry.md

Captured:
- Background: [class]
- Border: [class]
- Radius: [class]
- Text: [classes]
- Spacing: [classes]
- Hover: [class]

Any future component of this type should match these patterns.
```

If anything looked inconsistent or surprising during extraction — flag it:

```
Note: [Something that looked inconsistent or worth the
developer knowing about]
```

## Audit Mode — `/ui-snapshot audit`

Run this when the UI already exists and consistency is uncertain. Instead of capturing from one component, it scans the entire codebase, finds conflicts, and establishes a clean baseline before any further capturing happens.

### Step 1 — Scan all UI components

Find every component file in the project. Read each one. Build a complete picture of what visual patterns are currently in use across the entire interface.

### Step 2 — Identify conflicts

For each visual property that matters for consistency, list every variation found:

```
## UI Consistency Audit

### Conflicts found

**Border radius**
[List every rounded- variant found and which components use it]
Recommendation: [which one to standardise on and why]

**Background colors**
[List every bg- class found — flag any hardcoded hex values]
Recommendation: [which token classes should replace them]

**Text colors**
[List every text- color class found — flag any that bypass the design system]
Recommendation: [which token classes should replace them]

**Spacing**
[List padding and gap variations found]
Recommendation: [which values to standardise on]

**Border colors**
[List every border color class found]
Recommendation: [which token class to standardise on]

**Interactive states**
[List hover, focus, active variations found]
Recommendation: [which pattern to standardise on]

### Hardcoded values found
[List every hardcoded hex value, raw color class, or
non-token value found — with the file and line where it appears]
These must be replaced with design system tokens.

### Recommended baseline
[The correct pattern for each property —
based on what the majority already uses correctly
and what the design system defines]
```

### Step 3 — Wait for developer confirmation

Present the audit report. Do not fix anything. Do not update ui-registry.md yet.

Ask the developer:

```
Audit complete. [X] conflicts found across [Y] properties.

Before I establish the baseline in ui-registry.md:
1. Do the recommendations above look correct?
2. Are there any conflicts you want to resolve differently?
3. Should I flag the hardcoded values as issues to fix?

Confirm the baseline and I will write it to ui-registry.md.
```

### Step 4 — Write the confirmed baseline

After the developer confirms — write the agreed baseline to `context/ui-registry.md` as the foundation. Label it clearly:

```markdown
## Baseline — Established [date]

[Note: This baseline was established via /ui-snapshot audit]

| Property         | Correct class |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Card background  | [class]       |
| Card border      | [class]       |
| Card radius      | [class]       |
| Button primary   | [class]       |
| Button secondary | [class]       |
| Text primary     | [class]       |
| Text secondary   | [class]       |
| Text muted       | [class]       |
| Input background | [class]       |
| Input border     | [class]       |
```

### Step 5 — List what needs fixing

After writing the baseline, produce a fix list — every component that deviates from it:

```
## Components to fix

These components deviate from the confirmed baseline
and should be updated:

- [Component file] — [what is wrong] → [what it should be]
- [Component file] — [what is wrong] → [what it should be]
```

The developer can now fix these systematically — or fix them as they encounter each component. Either way, the baseline is established and `/ui-snapshot` can be used going forward to keep new components consistent.
